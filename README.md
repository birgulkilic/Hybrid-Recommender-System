What is a Hybrid Recommender System?

A Hybrid Recommender System combines multiple recommendation techniques to create more accurate and personalized suggestions. By merging different approaches, it overcomes the weaknesses of individual methods and improves overall recommendation quality.

How Does It Work?

Hybrid systems mix methods like:

âœ… Collaborative Filtering (based on user behavior)
âœ… Content-Based Filtering (based on item features)
Common Hybrid Approaches:

ðŸ”¹ Weighted Hybrid â€“ Combines different methods by assigning them weights.
ðŸ”¹ Switching Hybrid â€“ Switches between methods depending on the user or data.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Combination â€“ Merges features from multiple techniques into one model.
ðŸ”¹ Cascade Hybrid â€“ Uses one method first, then refines results with another.
By blending multiple techniques, hybrid systems make recommendations more relevant, diverse, and reliable. ðŸš€
